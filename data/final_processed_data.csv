P001,G1006,"The place itself was decent, but my experience wasn’t great. I had to leave earlier than expected because the host said I overstayed, even though I was never informed of the checkout time.

Also, I was blamed for a noise complaint from the neighbors, but I wasn’t even making noise. I kept things quiet and was out most of the time, so that was frustrating.

If communication had been clearer, this would have been a much better stay.

The property itself was great, but if you’re looking for a place where you can relax without feeling watched, this might not be the best option.ent!",Noise Violation
