- What I will do today 
--- I will complete Task 3 from the project plan today which is Label and Categorize VIolating Reviews. I will 
label the reviews as violating or non violating based on whether they contradict a property's predefined rules. This labeled data set will then be used to train a ML Model. 
END Deliverable - I will write a rule based labeling script using Python and Pandas to create a truth dataset.

- What I will do today?
 -- TASK 2: We need to define categories of property rule violations that the NLP model will 
detect in guest reviews
I will now match reviews with its respective properties based on the property_id defined in both to distinguish the 
reviews related to the properties. Then I will check if the review contains words related to property rules and then potentially
FLAG reviews that violate the rules. 
On 03/17/2025, I had already updated the properties.csv file to include these rules.
