- What I will do today?
 -- TASK 2: We need to define categories of property rule violations that the NLP model will 
detect in guest reviews
I will now match reviews with its respective properties based on the property_id defined in both to distinguish the 
reviews related to the properties. Then I will check if the review contains words related to property rules and then potentially
FLAG reviews that violate the rules. 
On 03/17/2025, I had already updated the properties.csv file to include these rules.
