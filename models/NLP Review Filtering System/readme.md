# Review Filtering System 
**Airbnb hosts often receive unfair or policy-violating reviews that negatively impact their property rankings and future bookings. 

Airbnb's customer service is slow and does not always remove such reviews.
We will build an NLP-based review filtering system to detect and flag reviews that violate property rules, allowing hosts to dispute them with Airbnb.
